      change direction of where you are going. '
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 0
  - Line: I've seen quite a few of those. And for some it mattered a great deal what
      kind of wheel you had on your ship. The feel when holding it, the responsiveness
      when turned and of course the right diameter; everything mattered apparently.

  - Line: Do you mean it doesn't matter anymore?
    Speaker: 0

  - Line: Yes, I guess back then created things were different, they were made with
      great care and detail for each boat and made to last a long time.

      soup. It's a thing, believe me. Or I guess believe one of the others who where
      with me here.
