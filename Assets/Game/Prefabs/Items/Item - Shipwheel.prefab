  - Line: Hey, what's this?
    Speaker: 0

  - Line: That's a ship's wheel. You use that to turn the rudder of the boat and change
      direction of where you are going. A bit of an old design there.
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 0
  - Line: I've seen quite a few of those. And for some it mattered a great deal what
      kind of wheel you had on your ship.
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 1
  - Line: The feel when holding it, the responsiveness when turned and of course the
      right diameter; everything mattered apparently.
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 0
  - Line: Do you mean it doesn't matter anymore?
    Speaker: 0
    DelayAfter: 0
  - Line: Yes, I guess back then created things were different, they were made with
      great care and detail for each boat and built to last.
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 6
  - Line: How do you know so much about all this stuff? I mean, you're a tortoise.
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 1
  - Line: In all my years here on this island I've heard many stories, from many different
      people. You're bound to learn a thing or two.
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 3
  - Line: Have you ever seen a boat come by here?
    Speaker: 0
    DelayAfter: 1
  - Line: 'I can remember two boats slowly passing by at a distance. From my description
      Malcolm later explained that they must have been fishing boats. '
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 0
  - Line: There must not be any good catch around here I guess.
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 0
  - Line: You didn't try to make them see you?
    Speaker: 0
    DelayAfter: 0.5
  - Line: How would I do that? I'm just a tortoise. And it's a good thing I wasn't
      able to, I'd prefer not to become tortoise soup. It's a thing, believe me. Or
      so I have been told.
    Speaker: 1
    DelayAfter: 2
  - Line: Who's Malcolm by the way?
    Speaker: 0
    DelayAfter: 3
  - Line: Just someone I used to know.
